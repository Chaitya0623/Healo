# Mental Health Chatbot

* The dataset contains Tags, Patterns (Questions asked to the chatbot) and Responses (Corresponding Solutions).
* The patterns are lemmatized so that questions with similar lemma can be correctly answered.
* The model is trained with the help of Neural Networks (Tensorflow, Keras) which helps us predict Responses for related Patterns.
* Sentiment Analysis is done with the help of transformers (BERT).
* If the model classifies tha chat to be high risk, it is directly connected to the nearest distress helpline.
* If the model classifies tha chat to be moderate risk, the case is matched to the right therapist.
* If the model classifies tha chat to be low risk, digital solutions are provided to the user.
